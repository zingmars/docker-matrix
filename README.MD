Docker-compose for Matrix and Riot
===

This repository contains a docker-compose and sample configuration files for Matrix, Riot and mxisd. This is meant for experimental and small scale use at best, not for live, public servers.

## Requirements

* Server with docker
* E-mail server
* Optional - a domain

## Setup

Go to [synapse](https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/), [mxisd](https://hub.docker.com/r/kamax/mxisd) and [riot-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/) docker pages and read about how to set them up. Then use this docker-compose. For just slightly more detailed instructions [click here](https://zingmars.info/2019/12/29/Running-a-personal-Matrix-server-using-docker/).
